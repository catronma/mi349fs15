<h3 id="beef">Smoking Beef</h3>
<p>With beef prices how they are, you might feel like you have to take a out a loan however, you also get what you pay for with beef. The cheaper "box store" cuts, are often low quality and there is only so much you can do to fix that. Actually, how your beef turns out has nothing to do with you and everything to do with the cow and how it was raised, what it ate, etc.
Picking out the perfect cut (brisket, ect) starts with making sure you buy a quality cut.</p>
<p>Look for a good red color in the meat. Other colors like brown and grey can mean the meat is not fresh. Fat color matters. White or cream colored fat means that the cow was fed corn and other cereals and is possible that it was kept in a smaller area and not allowed to roam very much. Not good news for the cow, but good for you as less movement means more marbling and a more tender meat.</p>

<h3 id="chicken">Smoking Chicken</h3>
<p>Brine your chicken by soaking it for 3-4 hours in a seasoned brine.  This helps ensure moister meat and adds flavor.  For 2 chickens I use 3/4 cup salt, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 tbsp peppercorns, 1 tbsp dried minced garlic, and enough water to fill the container.</p>
<p>Spatchcock:  A spatchcocked chicken is butterflied. This means it lies flat and in a smaller temperatures range for a more even cooking.</p>
<p>Wood:  Poultry takes smoke fairly easily.  Many people say to use a mild fruit wood for smoking chicken instead of hickory or oak. Many also say to experiment with both.  Use 2-3 chunks of hickory and 1-2 chunks of cherry for starters and see how you like it.</p>
<p>Smoke your chickens at 225-250 degrees for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours.  Remove them when they have obtained the appropriate internal safe temps.</p>

<h3 id="turkey">Smoking Turkey</h3>
<p>Many say smoking a turkey is the best way to cook a turkey. The flavor cannot be beat.  This method is juicy and moist that you will never cook your holiday turkeys in the oven, or fryer again.</p>

<p>Most people don't get to have the luxury of having a perfectly smoked turkey, but with your smoker and this recipes... you can produce the turkey that will have everyone bragging on your BBQ skills.</p>
<p>Setting your temp higher (at 275 - 300 degrees) allows you to get a skin that is more crispy than it is rubbery. </p>
<p>It normally takes about 3 - 3 1/2 hours to get it to the proper internal temp, but as you know some cookers cook differently.
Different people will tell you to cook your turkey to all different temps... some say 165, 170 or even 185.
Really, it's a personal preference however, you want to follow safe temperature practices.</p>
<p>Allow it to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving.</p>

<h3 id="pork">Smoking Pork</h3>
<h3>Pork Butt/Shoulder</h3>
<p>A good instant read thermometer is a must have piece of equipment.  When the internal temp gets to 160 degrees you need to stop adding smoke to the meat.</p>
<p>At this point the pours in the pork close and won't allow anymore smoke penetration.  Heavy smoke after 160 internal will cause the meat to have a really bad taste.  (Similar to lighter fluid)</p>
<p>Once the meat reaches 160 internal, I wrap the shoulders or butts in heavy duty aluminum foil.  This helps "tenderize" the meat. Leave the wrapped butts/shoulders on the smoker until you reach 195 degrees internal.
Unwrap at this point and vent for several minutes.  Carefully return the meat to the smoker and glaze with your sauce.
Following these tips will create the best Whole Shoulder or Butts every time.</p>
<h3>Pork Ribs  (3-2-1 Method)</h3>
<p>In a field such as BBQ, numbers bring a certain comfort which may explain the popularity of the 3-2-1 method for smoking ribs.</p>
<p>This process gives you a very tender product, with layers of flavor usually associated with excellent BBQ. Plus, within a predictable 6 hour time frame!
It is relatively fool proof, meaning if you follow the directions, you are almost guaranteed you will avoid dry or rubbery ribs.</p>

<h3 id="wildgame">Smoking Wild Game</h3>
<h3>Venison</h3>
<p>Deer or venison is a healthy alternative to beef because it is a red-meat with a similar flavor profile but is a much more lean type of meat. In fact, venison meat typically has 5-6 times less fat than smoked beef recipes. The most popular meats to smoke are typically high in fat content because the low and slow cooking method melts the fat during the smoking process which bastes the meat with moisture and flavor. That is why we always recommend putting the fat side up when putting any meat on the smoker and there is no need to flip it half way throughout the cooking process. The light fat content in venison meat (deer and elk) does create some challenges when smoking this delicacy, but that doesn't mean it can't be overcome with the right smoking tips. Just make sure you follow the recipe directions or your venison deer and elk recipes will tend to dry out during the low and slow smoking process. </p>
<h3>Duck and Goose</h3>
<p>Many people are fans of smoked duck and goose because it has a bolder flavor than other poultry like chicken. Duck and geese are made with all dark meat and has heavier bones than other birds. Keep this in mind if you are used to cooking enough food for your guests based off the weight of the bird. Duck and goose is also known for having more fat than other types of poultry, especially for a game bird. This fat content helps retain the moisture by basting the meat while smoking the bird. A good recipe will provide you with a crispy skin and meat that is so moist that practically falls off the bone.</p>

<h3 id="fish">Smoking Fish and Seafood</h3>
<h3>Fish</h3>
<p>Any fish can be smoked, but species high in fat (oil) such as salmon and trout are recommended because they absorb smoke faster and have better texture than lean fish, which tend to be dry and tough after smoking.
Use seasoned non-resinous woods: hickory, oak, apple, maple, birch, beech, or alder. Avoid: pine, fir, spruce, etc. or green woods. If heavier smoke flavor is desired, add moist sawdust to the heat source throughout the smoking process.</p>
<p>Control heat by adjusting air flow depending on your desired smoking type:</p>

<p>Hot-smoking:  90°F for the first 2 hours; 150°F for remaining smoking time</p>
<p>Cold-smoking:  80-90°F for 1-5 days or more</p>

<h3>Shrimp</h3>
<p>Remove the shrimp from the marinade, and skewer if desired. Discard the marinade. When the wood begins to smoke, place the shrimp in the grill and close the lid. Smoke the shrimp using indirect heat for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the shrimp have firmed up and are opaque. </p>
